## Our approach

We have documented all of the meetings we had during the development of this project on this repository's wiki. All page names are written in a format of 'MeetingType 00:00 01/01/2000'. Posts were made by individual members without agreement on a formal format. Each post summarizes the conversations had during the meeting.

## Testing

#### RSpec

`bundle exec rspec` to run all the RSpec feature and unit tests

#### Rubocop

`bundle` (if not installed)    
`rubocop` to run    

#### Test Coverage with Simplecov

Coverage reports are generated every time RSpec tests are run. To view the results:  
`bundle` (if not installed )   
`cd coverage`     
`open index.html`    

## Deployment

We deployed the application using Heroku. 

To deploy in the same way, first install the Heroku CLI. Then use the following commands:
```
heroku create
git push heroku master
```
Alternatively allow Travis (the Continuous Integration tool) to access your repo and deploy when you push to master â€“ when the build is working and passing all tests Travis will attempt to push to heroku. You will need to generate your own API key and encrypt it in order to use Travis and Heroku in this way. This is done by running
```travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key --org```
for travis-ci.org or
```travis encrypt $(heroku auth:token) --add deploy.api_key --pro```
for travis.ci.com.

#### Database cleaning

You can truncate the database by running
```
heroku pg:reset DATABASE --confirm { name-of-your-app-here }
heroku run rails db:migrate
```
This will clear and reset the database to working condition. You must have the required rights on the heroku project in order to do this.
